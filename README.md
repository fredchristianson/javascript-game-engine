There is an [intro video on youtube](https://youtu.be/ioV574iunR4).

There are other Discussions about project organization, tasks, and architecture. Feel free to read them or ignore them. I would like to minimize process and constraints.  If we see problems we'll make corrections.  


There are 2 purposes for this project

1. I thought it would be fun
2. I want to let JavaScript beginners I've met on Twitter participate in or watch a project being built.

This project is not

1. A web site
2. A JavaScript/NodeJS server
3. An example of development project processes and tools.

I plan to focus as much as possible on architecture and implementation to allow beginners to focus on those. They can see examples of processes and tools in other places.

I am very opinionated on architecture but open to a wide variety of things like project organization, style and naming conventions.

Depending on the opinions of other collaborators, we may keep things flexible. Or we can add processes, tools, and styles. I am not against anything, just want to make it as simple as possible for anyone wishing to participate.

Ideally, anyone can join us with

- A text editor
- Chrome
- git
- NodeJS (for a simple static file server)

The best way to reach me is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DevReliefFred).
